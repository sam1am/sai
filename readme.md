# Self-Assessment Infometric Ledger (SAIL) Application 📚

![SAIL Logo](./img/sailogo.png)

Embark on a journey of self-discovery with the **Self-Assessment Infometric Ledger (SAIL)**, a platform designed to shed light on your mental and emotional well-being through introspection and self-assessment. At the forefront of our toolset is the **Impact on Daily Life Depression Inventory (IDL-DI)**, a cornerstone tool aimed at gauging the influence of depressive symptoms on everyday function.

## Exciting Features 🌟

- Engage with insights through **Interactive Highlights** that invite users to focus on key aspects within the self-assessment by using the `==highlight==` syntax.

- Experience clarity with **Uniform Option Numbering**, ensuring consistency in the response process and aligning options with their corresponding result values.

- Enjoy content that is easier on the eyes thanks to **Superior Markdown Rendering** with the `rich` library, delivering a superior reading experience within the terminal.

## Setting Sail 🛠️

Before launching SAIL, ensure Python 3.x is aboard your system.

> 💡 For **Windows navigators**: Chart your course using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for the smoothest voyage.

Embark by:

1. Anchoring the SAIL repository on your machine.
2. Commanding your terminal to the project's map room (directory).
3. Unfurling the sails with `./autorun.sh`, which provisions your journey by setting up the environment and dependencies, and christens the SAIL voyage.

## Steering Your Self-Assessment 🗺️

As you hoist SAIL, you'll navigate to the main quarterdeck, where you're invited to select from a trove of self-assessment inventories. Each foray into self-evaluation begins with a welcome from Markdown-formatted guidelines, steering you through questions and reflecting your progress upon completion.

## Charting New Courses 🗺️

Creating a new self-assessment tool is like discovering uncharted waters. Here's how to chart your course:

1. Document your insights in a Markdown (.md) sailcloth and stow it in the `./interviews` chest.
2. Mark your path with queries and choices, and chart the scoring sextants within your document.
3. Rest assured, the SAIL crew will have your new map unfurled and ready for exploration upon the application’s next setting forth.

## The Compass of Open-Source (MIT License) 🧭

SAIL and the IDL-DI sail under the open skies of the MIT License, inviting broad collaboration and ensuring fair winds for modification, distribution, and improvements.

## Answering the Call of Collaboration 🤝

Contribute new self-assessment treasures, improve current charts, translate the tongues of the sea, or join an armada of research—all hands are on deck to enrich our collective journey.

## The Sextant of Discretion 🚫

Remember, SAIL's compass points towards self-awareness, not clinical shores. The IDL-DI and other tools within are not to be used as navigational aids for diagnosis. For uncharted territories of personal health, consult with professional cartographers (healthcare providers).

## Feature Spotlight: The IDL-DI 🎯

Within the `./paper` hold of our SAIL ship, you'll find the scholarly manuscript entitled:

**"Development and Open-Source Proposal of the Impact on Daily Life Depression Inventory (IDL-DI) for Personal Self-Assessment"**

In this paper, crafted by Sam Garfield & P-Tech, we unfurl a detailed depiction of the IDL-DI's origins, framework, and the collaborative ethos steering its development. The IDL-DI represents a beacon for those journeying through the effects of depression on daily life and serves as a testament to the potential of shared knowledge and openness in the realm of mental health.

Peruse these pages to delve into the sophisticated composition of the IDL-DI, and join us on a quest to navigate the challenges and rewards it presents, as we contribute to the betterment of mental health tools for all.
